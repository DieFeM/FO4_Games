# Fallout 4 Gambling
Play classic games of chance or skill in Fallout 4.

At the current stage, this mod allows the player to visit a casino and gamble at a Blackjack table. 
The casino can be found in a previously unused building across the street from the Goodneighbor entrance.
The player will have to pass either a Strength, Charisma, or credit check to be allowed inside. 
Once inside, the basement of the casino contains the Blackjack table, with it's own dealer.

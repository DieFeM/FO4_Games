## Ideas ##
* A new casino location.
* Perk and stat based effects on the games.
* Quests relating to the casino itself, work for the Pitboss. (similar to the work you could do for the Garret twins in FNV)
* Perk: Luck of the Draw
* * You always keep a trick up your sleeve.
* * When you accept this perk, choose a card. You hide this card in your boot. During a card game you may either choose to draw your next card or play the card in your boot.
